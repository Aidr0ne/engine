## Grid

Holds chunk data assuming 3.

## Chunking

Holds data about a 16 x 16 chunk

Asuming id system is used each item will be a u8 giving a total memory usage of 3.6 Kb

However Each object needs to be stored induvidualy so we will need to

have a big array with all objects


### Zoneing (Optional)

Holds a array of 16 x 16 chunks will be used for terrain generation (I hope)
